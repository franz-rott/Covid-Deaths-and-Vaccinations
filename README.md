# COVID-19 Data Analysis: Deaths and Vaccinations

## Description
This project focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 data, particularly regarding deaths and vaccinations. Utilizing two Excel datasets, one detailing COVID-19 related deaths and the other tracking vaccination progress, this project involves cleaning and merging these datasets using SQL to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact and the vaccination efforts.

## Dependencies
SQL Server or a similar SQL-based database system for data manipulation.
Excel or compatible software to view and manage the raw datasets.
Installing
Ensure that an SQL-based database system is installed for data processing.
Excel or a similar program should be installed to open and review the raw datasets.

## Data
The datasets include:
COVID-19 Deaths: Detailed information about COVID-19 related deaths, including dates, locations, age groups, and other demographics.
COVID-19 Vaccinations: Data on vaccination rates, including geographical distribution, number of doses administered, and demographic details.
Both datasets can be found in the "Covid Data.zip" file.

## Usage
Data Cleaning with SQL:
The SQL scripts provided in the "SQL Query.sql" file are tailored for cleaning both datasets.
Execute these scripts to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.

Data Merging:
After cleaning, use the provided SQL scripts to merge the two datasets.
The merging process is designed to align data by date and region for a cohesive analysis.
